We are currently working with
[Neuroscience Gateway - a portal for computational Neuroscience -](https://www.nsgportal.org/overview.html)
to perform computations on their [HPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-performance_computing) 
supercomputer. When the integration is complete registered users will be able to benefit from 
the HPC power and run our tools on a supercomputer cluster in the cloud.

To perform computations in the cloud please **download** our latest and greatest 
**[CLOUD COMPUTATION PACKAGE](/assets/cloudpackage-v1.zip).**

You will find **instructions on how to unpack and set it up after registration** at our 
**[[FORUM]](https://forum.neuroalgebra.net){:target="_blank"}**.
