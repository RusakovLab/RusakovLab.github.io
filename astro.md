**ASTRO** is computational tools to construct a realistic multi-compartmental astrocyte 
model that can be biophysically interrogated in [NEURON](https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/)
computational environment.

In this section, you can download **ASTRO 2.0** tool. The modelling tool **ASTRO** enables 
generating morphological and functional digital astroglia at various scales, also mimicking 
experiments in 3D tissue that surrounds the modelled astrocyte.

**There are 3 versions of Astro, all of them are free. Each version has its own method of installation.**
1. Basic source code. Local and remote computation of the user computers.
2. Self-installing version. Local computation. The version is avalibled after registration
3. Self-installing version. Local and Amazon clouds computations. Users ONLY pay for the time use of Amazon's super-power cloud computers.
