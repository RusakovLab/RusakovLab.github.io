**ASTRO** is a computational tool to construct a realistic multi-compartmental astrocyte 
model that can be biophysically interrogated in [NEURON](https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/)
computational environment, on the scale from nanometers to the entire cell moprhology. **ASTRO** generates stochastically cell nanoscopic protrusions based on their real-world parameters and enables dynamic interactions between the modelled astorcyte and the surrounding 3D tissue environment.

#### Installation

**There are three avaialbe installations of ASTRO**
1. Basic source code. Local and remote computation on your own computer.
2. Self-installing version. Local computation. The version is avalibled after registration.
3. Self-installing version. Local and Amazon clouds computations. Users ONLY pay 
   for the time use of Amazon AWS cloud resources.
