# ARACHNE

**ARACHNE** is a simulation environment in which neural and neuroglial 
network organisation, optimisation and execution benefit from pre-set, 
optimised parallel algorithms for remote computations, and from a 
friendly user interface which is operated from your own computer. 
Any neuroscientist without IT background will be able to incorporate the 
representative variety of biophysical mechanisms pertinent to nerve (or 
astroglial) cells, within a single network model in which the network 
complexity is limited only by the availability of remote computing resources, 
and not by the modelling kernel or its interface.

Creating and running realistic models of neural networks has hitherto been 
a task for computing professionals rather than experimental neuroscientists.
This is mainly because such networks usually engage substantial computational
resources, the handling of which requires specific programming skills. Here 
we put forward a newly developed simulation environment **ARACHNE**: it enables 
an investigator to build and explore cellular networks of arbitrary 
biophysical and architectural complexity using the logic of 
[NEURON](https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/)
and a simple interface on a local computer. The interface can control, 
through the internet, an optimized computational kernel installed on 
AMAZON cluster. **ARACHNE** can combine neuronal (wired) and astroglial 
(extracellular volume-transmission driven) network types and adopt realistic 
cell models from the [NEURON](https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/) library.

# Installation
