# ARACHNE

**ARACHNE** is designed to model spiking networks of neurons and astrocytes. It is equipped with optimised parallel algorithms for remote computations and a 
user-friendly interface. A neuroscientist without IT background should be able to incorporate a wide variety of biophysical mechanisms pertinent to nerve and astroglial cells, within a single network model. 

**ARACHNE**  enables an investigator to build and explore cellular networks of arbitrary 
biophysical and architectural complexity using the logic of 
[NEURON](https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/)
and a simple interface on a local computer. The operator can exercise online control over an optimized computational kernel installed on 
an AMAZON cluster. The network design can combine neuronal (wired) and astroglial (extracellular volume-transmitted) connections and adopt realistic 
cell models from [NEURON](https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/) library.
