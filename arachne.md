# ARACHNE
<div style="width: 50%; float: left; margin-right: 15px;"><img src="assets/arachne.jpg" alt="Arachne"></div>

**ARACHNE** is designed to model spiking networks of neurons and astrocytes. It benefist from  
optimised parallel algorithms for remote computations and a 
user-friendly interface operated from a local computer. 
A neuroscientist without IT background should be able to incorporate the 
representative variety of biophysical mechanisms pertinent to nerve and 
astroglial cells, within a single network model. 

A newly developed simulation environment of **ARACHNE**  enables 
an investigator to build and explore cellular networks of arbitrary 
biophysical and architectural complexity using the logic of 
[NEURON](https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/)
and a simple interface on a local computer. The interface can control, 
through the internet, an optimized computational kernel installed on 
AMAZON cluster. **ARACHNE** can combine neuronal (wired) and astroglial 
(extracellular volume-transmission driven) network types and adopt realistic 
cell models from the [NEURON](https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/) library.
