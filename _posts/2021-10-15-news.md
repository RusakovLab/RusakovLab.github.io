ASTRO 2.0. Interactive realistic model of protoplasmic astrocyte.

The simulation tool [**ASTRO**]({% link astro.md %}) helps to evaluate the 
multi-scale morphology of astroglia and to create a realistic, multi-compartmental biophysical 
model of an astrocyte that could be explored using [NEURON](https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/) 
computational environment.

Running Astro requires:

1. Host computer with MATLAB (2012 version or later).
2. NEURON (7.2 or later) under Windows 7 or Windows 10.
3. Fast internet connections to work with GUI on Amazon cloud.
4. Putty: a free SSH and Telnet client.
5. Xming X Server for Windows.
