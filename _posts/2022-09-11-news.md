[**ARACHNE**]({% link arachne.md %}) is a newly designed simulation environment 
in which neural and neuroglial network organisation, optimisation and 
execution take advantage of the preset, optimised parallel algorithms
for remote computations, and of a friendly user interface located on
a local computer.

The key advantage of [**ARACHNE**]({% link arachne.md %}) is that it enables 
creation and operation of complex neuronal-astroglial networks, with 
a simple and intuitive GUI, by neuroscientists unfamiliar with complex
programming and computational environment.
