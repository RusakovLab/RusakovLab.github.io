# Introduction {#introduction}


**Neuroalgebra is a set of computational tools and methods that help researchers understand how 
brain works** (be it a healthy one or not). Our approach is physical research of neuronal, astroglial, 
and cell-network mechanisms in the brain. (Modeling neural functions using AI is outside of our interests.) 

**To access the latest cutting-edge versions of our tools (ahead of github versions) please 
[[LOGIN]](https://forum.neuroalgebra.net){:target="_blank"}.**

   <!--![](assets/astro.jpg)-->
   [**ASTRO**]({% link astro.md %})
   builds a simulated multi-compartmental astrocyte model that
   can be biophysically interrogated in the [NEURON](https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/) 
   computational environment.

   <!--![](assets/neurons.jpg)-->
   <br>[**ARACHNE**]({% link arachne.md %}) 
   is a simulation environment to build and explore complex cellular 
   networks using the logic of [NEURON](https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/).

   <!--![](assets/neurons.jpg)-->
   [**BRAINCELL**]({% link braincell.md %}) is your gateway to understanding 
   the intricate world of brain cells. It is a wrapper around a popular
   [NEURON](https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/) software and significantly
   extends its capabilities.

<!--
Because exploration of realistic cell or networks models often requires significant 
computational resources, Neuroalgebra provides an option enabling ASTRO, ARACHNE and 
NEURON-platforms to run using Amazon computer cloud services (AWS). Currently, users 
registered at Neuroalgebra can run softwares for free on their local computer or pay 
directly to Amazon for their computing services if they use the AWS. 

_The website and its facilities are under continued development. Further T&C explanations pertinent to the payment options for cloud computing will be added imminently. We are developing more tools to make your brain cell and network models to work with the cloud - these will be added later on_
