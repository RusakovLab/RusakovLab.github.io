### Empowering Neuroscience: Our Suite of Computational Tools

We are proud to offer a trio of sophisticated computational tools, each designed to advance your neuroscience research. These tools are not only powerful but also free to use:

1. [**ASTRO**]({% link astro.md %}): dive into the world of astroglial cells with ASTRO. This tool integrates a multi-scale, three-dimensional astroglial architecture into a detailed multi-compartmental cell model. Rooted in empirical tests, ASTRO enhances the [NEURON platform](https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/), providing a realistic simulation environment.

2. [**ARACHNE**]({% link arachne.md %}): your gateway to creating and exploring intricate cellular networks. This simulation environment offers the flexibility to construct networks of varying biophysical and architectural complexity, leveraging the foundational logic of the [NEURON platform](https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/). Its intuitive interface is accessible on both local computers and mobile devices.

3. [**BRAINCELL**]({% link braincell.md %}): an advanced interface for the [NEURON platform](https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/), known for its extensive simulation capabilities for cellular and biophysical mechanisms. BRAINCELL enhances NEURON by adding refined control over inter-cell properties, spatial variations, external influences, and stochastic elements, offering a richer simulation experience.

4. **CLOUD COMPUTATION:** we are currently working with
   [Neuroscience Gateway - a portal for computational Neuroscience](https://www.nsgportal.org/overview.html)
   to perform computations on their [HPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-performance_computing) 
   supercomputer. When the integration is complete registered users will be able to benefit from 
   the HPC power and run our tools on a supercomputer cluster in the cloud.

   To perform computations in the cloud please **download** our latest and greatest 
   **[CLOUD COMPUTATION PACKAGE](/assets/cloudpackage-v1.zip).** You will find
   **instructions on how to unpack and set it up after**
   **[[Registration at our FORUM]](https://forum.neuroalgebra.net/ucp.php?mode=register){:target="_blank"}**.
