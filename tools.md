### Computational Tools

1. [**ASTRO**]({% link astro.md %}) is a computational platform for constructing and exploring realistic multi-compartmental astrocyte models that can be biophysically interrogated in NEURON computational environment, on the scale from nanometers to the entire cell moprhology. ASTRO generates stochastically cell nanoscopic protrusions based on their real-world parameters and enables dynamic interactions between the modelled astorcyte and the surrounding 3D tissue environment.

2. [**ARACHNE**]({% link arachne.md %}) is designed to model multi-cell spiking networks of neurons and astrocytes. In ARACHNE environment, the network organisation, optimisation, and execution benefit from pre-set, optimised parallel algorithms for remote computations and a friendly user interface operated from your own computer. A neuroscientist without IT background should be able to incorporate the representative variety of biophysical mechanisms pertinent to nerve and astroglial cells, within a single network model.

3. [**BRAINCELL**]({% link braincell.md %}): an advanced interface for the [NEURON platform](https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/), known for its extensive simulation capabilities for cellular and biophysical mechanisms. BRAINCELL enhances NEURON by adding refined control over inter-cell properties, spatial variations, external influences, and stochastic elements, offering a richer simulation experience.

4. **CLOUD COMPUTATION:** we are currently working with
   [Neuroscience Gateway - a portal for computational Neuroscience](https://www.nsgportal.org/overview.html)
   to perform computations on their [HPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-performance_computing) 
   supercomputer. When the integration is complete, registered users will be able to benefit from 
   the HPC power and run our tools on a supercomputer cluster in the cloud.

   To perform computations in the cloud please **download** our latest and greatest 
   **[CLOUD COMPUTATION PACKAGE]({% link assets/cloudpackage-v1.zip %}).** You will find
   **instructions on how to unpack and set it up after**
   **[[Registration at our FORUM]](https://forum.neuroalgebra.net/ucp.php?mode=register){:target="_blank"}**.
