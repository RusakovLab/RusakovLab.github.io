### Empowering Neuroscience: Our Suite of Computational Tools

We are proud to offer a trio of sophisticated computational tools, each designed to advance your research in neuroscience. These tools are not only powerful but also free to use:

1. [**ASTRO**]({% link astro.md %}): Dive into the world of astroglial cells with ASTRO. This tool integrates a multi-scale, three-dimensional astroglial architecture into a detailed multi-compartmental cell model. Rooted in empirical tests, ASTRO enhances the [NEURON platform](https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/), providing a realistic simulation environment.

   *Nat Commun. 2018 Sep 3;9(1):3554. doi: 10.1038/s41467-018-05896-w.*

2. [**ARACHNE**]({% link arachne.md %}): ARACHNE is your gateway to creating and exploring intricate cellular networks. This simulation environment offers the flexibility to construct networks of varying biophysical and architectural complexity, leveraging the foundational logic of the [NEURON platform](https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/). Its intuitive interface is accessible on both local computers and mobile devices.

3. [**BRAINCELL**]({% link braincell.md %}): BRAINCELL is an advanced interface for the [NEURON platform](https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/), known for its extensive simulation capabilities for cellular and biophysical mechanisms. BRAINCELL enhances NEURON by adding refined control over inter-cell properties, spatial variations, external influences, and stochastic elements, offering a richer simulation experience.
